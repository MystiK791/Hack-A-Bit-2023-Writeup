## Powerhouse

I ended up getting help with this one. I was given the following challenge:

I read the learning material, but didn't pay close attention to it. This turned out to be a *huge* faux pas. I began by Googling “rsa key find p q given N and e” and found [this program](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/Powerhouse.py) on Stack Overflow:

    if a == 0:
        return (b, 0, 1)
    else:
        g, y, x = egcd(b % a, a)
        return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)
    
    def modinv(a, m):
        g, x, y = egcd(a, m)
        if g != 1:
            raise Exception('modular inverse does not exist')
        else:
            return x % m
    
    def factor(n):
        for i in range(3, n):
            if n%i == 0:
                return i
    
    e = 1187
    n = 6176128969
    
    p = factor(n)
    q = n//p
    phi_n = (p-1) * (q-1)
    
    # Only for python >= 3.8
    # From https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow
    # If mod is present and exp is negative, base must be relatively prime to mod.
    # In that case, pow(inv_base, -exp, mod) is returned, where inv_base is an inverse to base modulo mod.
    # d_crack = pow(e, -1, phi_n)
    
    # python < 3.8
    d_crack = modinv(e, phi_n)
    
    print('cracked d:', d_crack) # prints "cracked d: 101"

After running the code, I was given the value of d, which was 83242763.

I then Googled “how to find rsa key p q given d”, and found that supposedly p * q = d. This turned out to be false, and I most likely misinterpreted the information I read. 
With this (incorrect) knowledge, I made [this program](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/Powerhouse%20P2.py) to try to bruteforce p \* q = d:
    
```
n = 83242763

p = 1
q = 1

for i in range(83242763):
    for j in range(83242763):
        if (p * q) == n and p != 83242763 and q != 83242763:
            print(p)
            print(q)
            break
        p += 1
    p = 1
    q += 1
```

(note: for some reason I defined d as n here. My bad :P)

I’m not kidding when I said this program ran for a combined total of HOURS with no result. I decided it was time to get help. I conferred with a very helpful fellow competitor, and found out two very important things:  

1. Python is awful at calculating factors using this method
    

2. As stated previously, p * q does not equal d. As it turns out, p * q equals N.

I then did what I should have done in the first place: I Googled a [factor calculator](https://www.calculator.net/factor-calculator.html) and put N into it.

Obviously the answer wasn’t 1 * 6176128969. I went back to the challenge website, put 11329;545161 into the answer box, and that was correct. As it turns out e was irrelevant. Go figure.
