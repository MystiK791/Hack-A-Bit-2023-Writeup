## Trending
Trending was simultaneously the most fun and frustrating challenge in the entire competition so far. We were given the following string:
 

    b18f21b19e0f86b22d218c86e182214b867b36212576b2617e8c03862d369e

We were also given the [Python code](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/hashbrown.py) used to generate the string:

    #!/usr/bin/python3
    
    import sys
    
    import hashlib
    
    import random
    
    import string
    
    try:
    
	    # get a five character string to use for randomness (lol)
	    one_time_pad_or_something = ''.join(random.choices(string.digits, k=5))
    
	    print(one_time_pad_or_something)
    
	    # itterate over each character in the input
	    for index,character in enumerate(sys.argv[1]):
    
		    # get md5 hash of (that character plus minus pad)
		    calculated_character = chr(ord(character) - int(one_time_pad_or_something[index % 5]))
    
		    full_md5_hash = hashlib.md5(calculated_character.encode('ascii'))
    
		    # take the first four characters and print them to the screen
		    print(full_md5_hash.hexdigest()[0:2], end="")
    
	    # new line at end of output
	    print()
    
    # verify that we got input in position
    except IndexError: sys.exit("Usage: python3 hashbrown.py <plaintext>") 
    
    
After experimenting with the code for awhile, and going through it line by line, I came up with the [following writeup](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/Hashbrown%20Writeup.txt):
    
    OTP is calculated by:
    	Ranomly selecting 5 numbers between 0 and 9
    	
    Hash algorithm:
    	For every character in the input:
    		calculated_character = 
    			- The ascii value of the selected character
    			- Subtracted by the following:
    				- The OTP at index[The character's index % 5]
    			- The result converted into an ASCII character
    				- For example, if the OTP is 13253, and the input string is "bananas", encrypting the 's' would look like:
    					- calculated_character = chr(ord('s') - int(otp[index %5}))
    					- calculated_character = chr(115 - int(otp[1]))
    					- calculated_character = chr(115 - 3)
    					- calculated_character = chr(112)
    					- calculated_character = 'p'
    		full_md5_hash =
    			- md5 hash of the following:
    				- calculated_character encoded into ascii
    		Appends the first 2 characters of the hexdigested md5 hash to the result
    			- This means that the source text length is double the length of the input

The text is probably pretty confusing since I wrote it for myself to reference, not to present. I’ll go through it step by step:

-   OTP calculation is pretty self-explanatory. It selects 5 numbers between 0 and 9. This will be the “magic number” that helps encrypt the input
    
-   The algorithm then goes through every individual character in the input, and does the following:

	-   Gets the ASCII value of each character (essentially this is just a number that tells a computer what each character is)
    
	-   Gets the character’s position in the input string, aka its “index”
    
	-   It selects a number from the OTP based on the remainder of the character’s index divided by five
		- The function here is known as modulus, and is read as "index, modulus of 5". 
		- The modulus makes sure that the program never tries to select a part of the OTP that doesn’t exist, as the remainder will always be between 1 and 5.
   
-   The program subtracts the ASCII value of the selected character by the selected part of the OTP (essentially "left-shifting" or "down-shifting" the character).
   
-   The program converts the new ASCII value back into a character
    
-   The program gets the SHA-256 (an encryption algorithm) value of the character, known as the "hash", then converts the hash to hexadecimal format. 

- The first two characters of this hexadecimal string are appended to the output

(I wrote an example in the text above, if this beast of an encryption algorithm is still confusing)
    

With this knowledge, I quickly devised a method to reverse-engineer the hash given (the original document can be found [here](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/Hashbrown%20Writeup%20P2.txt)):

    Cracking strategy:
	- Length of source text can be found by dividing the length of the encrypted text by 2
	- ASCII encrypted string can be found by:
		- Dividing the fully encrypted string into 2-character-long chunks
		- Defining a list called result_chars
		- For every chunk in the string:
			- Try all ASCII characters (could be optimized by defining the maximum 'shift' of each encrypted character, but the performance gain is minimal)
			- md5 hash the current character
			- Hexdigest the hash with a 2-character truncation
			- Compare the hexdigest to the original chunk
			- If they match, append the hexdigest to result_chars
			- Note: technically the first 5 characters wouldn't need to be bruteforced, however, I'm lazy :P
	- Run ord() on every value in result_chars, and saving the result to a list called ord_chars
	- OTP can be fully cracked with the following methodology
		- We know the first 5 characters are "flag{"
		- The OTP cannot be more than 5 characters long
		- The difference between the hashed and known ords is the part of the OTP that was used. 
		- The full OTP can be retrieved by using this equation on the first 5 characters
			- Define "flag{" as a string called "knownpart"
			- Use the following equation:
				- set OTP to ''
				- For the first 5 characters:
					OTP[index] = (ord(knownpart[index]) - ord_chars[index])
	- Define result as a blank srting
	- For every ascii value in ord_chars:
		- result += chr(ord_chars[index] + int[otp[index%5]})
	- Print result
	
	Encryption broken :)


I then put together a [Python program](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/DeathToHashbrowns.py), which I named “DeathToHashbrowns”:

  

  

    import hashlib
    import string
        
    source = "b18f21b19e0f86b22d218c86e182214b867b36212576b2617e8c03862d369e"
        
    source_split = [source[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(source), 2)]
        
    print(source_split)
        
    def bruteForceAscii(target):
        min_index = 0
        max_index = 127
        guess = min_index
        decrypted = ''
        result = ''
        while result != target and guess <= max_index:
            decrypted = chr(guess)
            md5h = hashlib.md5(decrypted.encode('ascii'))
            result = md5h.hexdigest()[0:2]
            if result == target:
                print(result, end = "")
                return decrypted   
            else:
                guess += 1
      
        
    def convertToAscii(list_of_char):
        result = []
        for i in range(len(list_of_char)):
            result.append(ord(list_of_char[i]))
        return result
        
    def verify(list_of_char):
        for char in list_of_char:
            md5h = hashlib.md5(char.encode('ascii'))
            result = md5h.hexdigest()[0:2]
            print(result, end="")
        print("\n")
        
    def verifyAscii(list_of_char):
        for char in list_of_char:
            chrchar = chr(char)
            md5h = hashlib.md5(chrchar.encode('ascii'))
            result = md5h.hexdigest()[0:2]
            print(result, end="")
        print("\n")
        
    def crackOTP(knownFive, encryptedFive):
        otp = ''
        i = 0
        print(knownFive)
        print(encryptedFive)
        for i in range(len(knownFive)):
            ordEnc = ord(encryptedFive[i])
            ordKnow = ord(knownFive[i])
            print(ord(knownFive[i]))
            print(ord(encryptedFive[i]))
            otp = otp + str(ordKnow - ordEnc)
        return otp
        
    def decryptString(encryptedString, otp):
        string = ''
        i = 0
        for i in range(len(encryptedString)):
            string = string + chr(encryptedString[i] + int(otp[i % 5]))
        return string
        
    result_chars = []
        
    for char in source_split:
        result_chars.append(bruteForceAscii(char))
        
    print(result_chars)
      
    verify(result_chars)
        
    flag = ['f', 'l', 'a', 'g', '{']
       
    known = []
        
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
        known.append(result_chars[i])
        
    otp = crackOTP(flag, known)
        
    print(otp)
    
    result_ascii = convertToAscii(result_chars)
    print(decryptString(result_ascii, otp))


Here’s what the program does, function by function:
    

-   The code at the top imports the required modules, defines the encrypted string to reverse, and then splits the hash into two-character “chunks”. 
	- Remember, for every character in the input of the original algorithm, the result would have two. Therefore, every two characters in the hash represents a single human-readable character. 
- Finally, the code prints out the split hash for debugging purposes

- From there, all functions are defined and programmed:
	-   `bruteForceAscii()` guesses every character in the ascii table between the specified ranges (min_index and max_index). It does the same set of steps that the original hashbrown code did to every shifted character. Finally, it compares the processed character to the target that was given to the function (one of the aforementioned “chunks”).
    
-   `convertToAscii()` converts a list of characters to a list of ASCII values.
    
-   `verify()` is pretty self-explanatory: it takes a list of ASCII characters and then does the same cryptography the original hashbrown code did. It then returns the result of said code to be checked against the original hash. This is mainly for debugging purposes.
    
-   `verifyAscii()` is a hand-rewritten duplicate of `verify()` to make sure I didn’t make any mistakes programming either function.
    
-   `crackOTP()` takes the known first five characters of the hash we’re trying to reverse (“flag{“ in this case), and the first five characters from the result of `bruteForceAscii()`.
	- Because of the way the OTP was calculated, we know that the first five characters of the hash were encrypted with the OTP in sequential order. 
		- For example, if the original OTP was 18956, the first character would have been encrypted with a 1, the second with an 8, and so on.
	-  Using this knowledge, we can take the ASCII values of the known characters, and subtract them from the result of bruteForceAscii. We then have the OTP.
    
-   `decryptString()` is the exact opposite of hashbrown’s main loop. It takes the recovered OTP and the result of bruteForceAscii as inputs, and for every character in the result, it does the following:
    

	-   It gets the ASCII value of the character
    
	-   It gets the character’s position in the input (its “index”)
    
	-   Just like hashbrown, it selects a number from the OTP based on the remainder of the character’s index divided by five.
    
	-   The program adds the ASCII value with the selected part of the OTP.
    
	-   The program converts the new ASCII value back into a character
    

After two hours of studying, planning, coding, and debugging, the program was ready to go!
    
    =================== RESTART: DeathToHashbrowns.py ===================
    (?_%	cloaqWgax#manylZeq$oq


Ok, maybe it wasn't quite ready to go yet then. I proceeded to add a bunch of debugging code to the program, trying to figure out what exactly went wrong. The ASCII characters were correct, the verifyASCII check passed, and crackOTP looked like it was doing its job just fine.
    

![](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/Hashbrown%20Console%20Output.png?raw=true)

Nonetheless, I kept getting the same result. Frustrated, I took a break. Maybe I was just tired. When I came back, I experimented with the original hashbrown code, going through it line by line in the Python shell to see what I was missing. I also referenced ASCII table, and realized something.

![ASCII Table](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/ASCII%20table.gif?raw=true)([source](https://www.asciitable.com/))
    
I knew for a fact that the string I was trying to find was all lowercase letters, underscores, and brackets. If the character with the lowest ASCII value was “_”, with a value of 95, and the OTP was all numbers between 1 and 9, the lowest possible ASCII value should be 95-9=86. Therefore, why did I have characters like “(” or “?” in my result? They were way too far out of range. An ember of an idea playing at the edges of my mind, I went back into the Python shell and experimented a little more.
   
I re-ran hashbrown with the pre-defined OTP “13253” and the input “flag{“, and got the encrypted string “e186b1929d”. I then defined two functions in the shell: 
- `bruteForceAscii()`, which is a direct copy from DeathToHashbrowns
- `bruteForceAscii2()` (what a clever name!), which is `bruteForceAscii()` modified so that I could define an ascii value to process myself. 

I gave both functions the first chunk of the new string (`e1`), set the ascii value of bruteForceAscii2 to 101, and finally got some answers:

![](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/Hashbrown%20Breakthrough.png?raw=true)
(note: 101 is the ASCII value of the letter “f”, shifted by the first digit of the new OTP, resulting in the ASCII value of the letter "e")

As it turns out, two completely different ASCII values were capable of returning the same chunk data! Knowing this, I adjusted the range of `bruteForceAscii()` to begin at ASCII value 95 (the lowest possible ASCII value for any text in the flag) and end at 127. I re-ran the program, held my breath, and was presented with the flag:

(note: I don't know why there was a stray "Y" in the flag. Feel free to submit an issue if anyone figures it out!)
