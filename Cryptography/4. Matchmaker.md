## Matchmaker

I made this challenge *way* too hard on myself. We were given the following string:  

Dg0DDxoRBz4PHQIKNxIbBQwHHBMbFQ==
    
From the challenge description, I knew the following:
-   Something was encrypted via XOR
    
-   The key was “hab” in UTF-8 format
    
Similar to [homerun](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/1.%20Homerun.md), every XOR decoder I used returned gibberish. I assumed the reason why was because the key was encoded in UTF-8, which none of the decoders I used supported. They did support hexidecimal keys though, so I tried converting the key. I put it all into my XOR decoder, and was absolutely sure I’d found the answer!

Oh… guess I didn’t. Back to the drawing board I guess… I decided to read the discord support thread for this challenge, and found the following:

Cyberchef! Of course! In case you don’t know, [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) is an online website that’s essentially a swiss army knife for computer data. We were given a link to it at the beginning of the competition as a resource, but I’d forgotten all about it. I went to the website, and found that its XOR decoder had an option for a UTF-8 formatted key. Awesome! Now all I need to do is paste in the string, and…

I  was sure that I'd figured out how to get the flag, but I ended up with more nonsense. After thinking things through a bit more, I realized something. You’ve probably already figured it out, and I was surprised I hadn’t sooner (especially given that it was basically spelled out in the Discord conversation above). This string was also encoded with my old friend base64. Aha! From there, I instructed Cyberchef to run a base64 decoder on the string *before* attempting to undo the XOR. Fingers crossed...
