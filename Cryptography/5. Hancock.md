## Hancock:

This challenge was a blast to solve. We were given the following prompt

![](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/Hancock%20Challenge%20Info.png?raw=true)

The first thing I did was check the learning references, and learned 4 important points of information :    
-   This is a Java Web Token (JWT)
-   Every JWT is signed with a secret “key” that allows a system to check if it’s been modified.
-   If the key changes, at least part of the JWT changes as well.
-   JWTs are fully decodable without knowing the secret key.
    

I then went to Cyberchef, to see what the contents of the token were:
 

       {
        
	        "sub": "1234567890",
        
	        "name": "John Doe",
        
	        "iat": 1234567890,
        
	        "admin": false
        
        }

I know that the secret is one of the entries in the RockYou word list, but the list has millions of passwords in it. To try to figure it out by hand would take an eternity, so I decided to let a computer do it for me. I whipped up a [Python script](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Cryptography/Assets/Bruteforce%20Signature.py) to sign the data I decoded with every password in the RockYou word list, and then compare the result to the original JWT. If the JWT is a match, it would print the word it was signed with:

    import jwt
    
    target = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxMjM0NTY3ODkwLCJhZG1pbiI6ZmFsc2V9.QR_da_OHe58LBwBRt5S_aTcbMkBhEFqJkFn7zUq7Yyc'
    
    rawData = {
    
	    "sub": "1234567890",
    
	    "name": "John Doe",
    
	    "iat": 1234567890,
    
	    "admin": False
    
    }
    
    rockYou = []
    
    with open('rockyou.txt', 'r', encoding='ANSI') as f:
    
	    for line in f:
    
		    rockYou.append(line.strip())
    
    foundKey = ''
    
    tries = 0
    
    for secret in rockYou:
    
	    tries += 1
    
	    encoded = jwt.encode(rawData, secret, algorithm = 'HS256')
    
	    if encoded == target:
    
		    foundKey = secret
    
		    print(encoded + " " + target)
    
		    break
    
    print("The signature was " + foundKey + ". Found after " + str(tries) + " tries.")

About 20 seconds after running the program:

-   I had the secret. The challenge was solved.
