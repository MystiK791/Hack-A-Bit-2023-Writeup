I unfortunately never managed to complete this one. We were given a text document consisting entirely of... emojis. Yes, emojis, and we were supposed to turn it back into a readable string:

Not sure where to start, I consulted the learning material, which taught me about how emojis are encoded. Like normal characters, they are represented by a Unicode Value, which is a string of letters and numbers a computer then interprets, and renders it as a human-readable character (or in this case, an emoji). I thought that maybe the key to the flag was somewhere in the emojis' Unicode data, so I ran each emoji through a decoder and… nada. By now, other people had begun solving the challenge, so I asked for help. Turns out, I was way overcomplicating things, and that the flag could be derived just by assigning each emoji to a letter. 

That’s where I got stuck. I tried multiple different letters for each emoji, and the closest I got to deciphering the flag was spelling out the word “lean”. I immediately knew that was incorrect; when going through the rest of the text, the letters I assigned to the emojis that spelled "lean" formed nothing coherent.

 Sadly, I never found out the answer to this challenge, but I have a theory as to why. Emojis, as plain as they’re meant to be, can often mean different things to different people. For example, 🤗 can mean a couple of things:
    

-   Hello (if you focus on the hands, they look like they’re waving)
    
-   Hugging (the emoji’s intended purpose)
    
-   Love (an extension of the hugging interpretation)
    
As you can see, there are few emojis that you can assign just one letter to. That, or I’m just stupid 😛.

Note: after reading other competitors' writeups on Smiley, I concluded that I was trying to go about this the wrong way. Turns out, there _was_ some information in the Unicode values of each emoji. Once processed, they resulted in a cryptogram. ([source](https://thesavageteddy.github.io/posts/writeups-hackabit2023/#smiley-100))
