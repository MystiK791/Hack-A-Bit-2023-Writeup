## Homerun

This challenge was super sneaky. We were given the following string to decode:

Being somewhat familiar with Base64, I assumed the 3 equals signs at the end meant that the string was base64-encoded. I ran the string through a gauntlet of online decoders, but they all returned nonsense. Even a script I wrote myself, using Python’s built-in base64 decoder, gave me the following error:
    
    binascii.Error: Invalid base64-encoded string: number of data characters (69) cannot be 1 more than a multiple of 4

I've never seen this error before, and didn't even know where to begin debugging it. I did some research, believing that the given string was corrupt somehow. I was reassured by others who had solved Homerun that the string was definitely healthy. I was also reminded that base64 strings always have lowercase characters, which was interesting. I Googled “base64 all uppercase”, and found that the string was not base64-encoded at all. It was base*32* encoded. Armed with this knowledge, I ran the string through a base32 decoder, and behold:
    
    flag{GottaMakeSureYouHearAboutThatLongBall}

After solving the challenge, I decided to make a program just for fun that could decode and encode both base64 and base32 encoded strings, with automatic differentiation between the two. It can be found [here](https://github.com/MystiK791/supamayo64).
