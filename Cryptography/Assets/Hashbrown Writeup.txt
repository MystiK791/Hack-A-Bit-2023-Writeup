OTP is calculated by:
	Ranomly selecting 5 numbers between 0 and 9
	
Hash algorithm:
	For every character in the input:
		calculated_character = 
			- The ascii value of the selected character
			- Subtracted by the following:
				- The OTP at index[The character's index % 5]
			- The result converted into an ASCII character
				- For example, if the OTP is 13253, and the input string is "bananas", encrypting the 's' would look like:
					- calculated_character = chr(ord('s') - int(otp[index %5}))
					- calculated_character = chr(115 - int(otp[1]))
					- calculated_character = chr(115 - 3)
					- calculated_character = chr(112)
					- calculated_character = 'p'
		full_md5_hash =
			- md5 hash of the following:
				- calculated_character encoded into ascii
		Appends the first 2 characters of the hexdigested md5 hash to the result
			- This means that the source text length is double the length of the input
