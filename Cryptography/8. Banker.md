This challenge was easy once I figured out how to use the tools given. We were given the following hashed PIN:

    320f5cef77246cdce15f9b66e9e4f3ad22f506f9cd28d85e7ccc8839b301e736

We were also told that it was between 4-8 characters, and all numeric.
    
I consulted the learning material, and was recommended the tool John The Ripper to crack the PIN. I downloaded it, set it up, and did some research on how to use the tool. Fortunately JTR comes with a whole library’s worth of documentation, bundled right within the download. How convenient! I then followed the following steps to crack the password:
- I verified the PIN was in SHA-265 format using an online encryption guesser
- I copied and pasted the PIN into a file called password.txt.
    
- I unfortunately don't remember and can't recreate the exact command I used. I do remember that I ran a command specifying the following:
	- All passwords to bruteforce are stored in password.txt
	- The password was in SHA-256 format
	- The password was all numeric

(Note: I could have specified the minimum and maximum length of the password, but my laptop has a very fast CPU, so it didn’t matter all that much)

After about 5 minutes, I was presented with the key ``05593620``, which was the correct answer.
