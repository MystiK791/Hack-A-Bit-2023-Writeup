## Mason
This challenge was trivial to solve. We were given this blob of data with no other context (aside from a witty quote reading "The numbers Mason, what do they mean?":  

    66 6c 61 67 7b 63 6f 6d 70 75 74 65 72 3a 69 5f 6f
    6e 6c 79 5f 75 6e 64 65 72 73 74 61 6e 64 5f 62 69
    6e 61 72 79 5f 64 75 64 65 7d
    
I immediately knew it was hexidecimal data. Having taken a programming course in college where I had hex and binary essentially drilled into my head, I identified the format based on the following characteristics:
- A mix of letters and numbers, with the highest number being 9 and the highest letter being F
- Separation every two characters, resulting in array of bytes 2 digits long
    
From there it was as simple as going to [a hex to ascii converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html), pasting the blob in, and the flag was mine:
