## Hack-A-Bit 2023 Writeup
Welcome! Here you'll find writeups on all the challenges of the Programming (unfinished) and Cryptography categories of Hack-A-Bit.

The repo is structured as follows:
- Each folder in the root of the repo represents a category
- Inside each folder, there are a collection of MarkDown documents. Each document contains each individual writeup on each individual challenge.
- Inside each category folder, there is also an Assets folder. These contain data such as images, text documents, and source code. These are all referenced by the aforementioned MarkDown documents.

Enjoy! ;)
