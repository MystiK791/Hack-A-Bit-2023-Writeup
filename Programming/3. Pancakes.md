## Pancakes
We were given a ZIP file with the same binary compiled for a bunch of different CPU architectures. We were challenged with finding which binary was compatible with our machine, and then running that binary for the flag. 

I found out that you can use the `file` command in Linux to get information about a binary, including what CPU it’s made for. I put together a simple Bash script to go through each binary, and run `file` on each of them:

`for file in *; do file "$file"; done`

I ran the first x86-x64 binary I saw, which was the 18th one. It printed the flag:

`flag{bob_the_architect}`

After submitting the flag, I devised another way to solve Pancakes. There’s a program on Linux called qemu-user that allows a machine to run binaries compiled for different architectures, while seamlessly integrating into the host OS (as opposed to running a full system emulator or VM). For example, one could run a program (such as Minecraft: Raspberry Pi Edition) meant for an ARM processor on an Intel-based PC, without having to fully emulate an ARM machine. After installing qemu-user, one could simply run any binary (except for a select few, which seemed to be corrupt) and get the flag that way.
