## Linguist
We were given a [Python program](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/Assets/linguist.py) to analyze:
    
    import random
    import time
    
    flag = b"\xf9\xf3\xfe\xf8\xe4\xeb\xf7\xf6\xec\xc0\xf6\xec\xf1\xeb\xc0\xec\xef\xfe\xf1\xf6\xec\xf7\xc0\xfd\xea\xeb\xc0\xf6\xc0\xec\xeb\xf6\xf3\xf3\xc0\xf1\xfa\xfa\xfb\xc0\xfe\xf1\xc0\xf6\xf1\xeb\xfa\xed\xef\xed\xfa\xeb\xfa\xed\xe2"
    
    class ANSI:
        COLORS = [ "\033[0;30m", "\033[0;31m", "\033[0;32m", "\033[0;33m", "\033[0;34m", "\033[0;35m",
                   "\033[0;36m", "\033[0;37m", "\033[1;30m", "\033[1;31m", "\033[1;32m", "\033[1;33m",
                   "\033[1;34m", "\033[1;35m", "\033[1;36m", "\033[1;37m" ]
    
        STYLES = [ "\033[1m", "\033[2m", "\033[3m", "\033[4m", "\033[5m", "\033[7m", "\033[9m" ]
        
        END = "\033[0m"
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        try:
            while True:
                print("",end="\r")
                for i in flag: print(f"{random.choice(ANSI.COLORS)}{chr(i ^ 0x9F)}{ANSI.END}", end="")
                time.sleep(0.1)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("",end="\r")
            for i in flag: print(f"{chr(i ^ 0x9F)}", end="")
            print("  ")

Line 21 caught my eye immediately. Line 21 begins with an `except` statement, which is meant to catch and handle errors in a controlled way (as opposed to the program outright crashing). It was given the error `KeyboardInterrupt` to handle. A Keyboard Interrupt is when a user forcefully terminates a program by pressing Ctrl+C. In the case of Python, a Keyboard Interrupt can alternatively be simulated by pressing the "Interrupt Execution" button in IDLE. I ran the program, and then pressed Ctrl+C:

I now had the flag and therefore solved the challenge, but I was still confused. What were those other characters? What were those references to color? I theorized that the weird characters that the program was printing were color codes, which I knew from past experience that IDLE just prints as plain text. However, color codes are meant to be invisible, and serve the purpose of coloring any text that follows it. Curious, I ran the Linguist code in a terminal emulator:

Hey, this is pretty awesome! As it turns out, the KeyboardInterrupt handler was there so that when the user exited from the program in a terminal, it would print the flag in plaintext so that it would still be visible. Since all IDLE knows how to handle is plaintext, performing a keyboardinterrupt made the flag visible.
