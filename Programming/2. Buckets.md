## Buckets
This challenge was extremely similar to Blobs. We were given [a text file](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/Assets/buckets.txt) with thousands of names in it. We were told to take the number of times the names “danny” and “elise” appear, and multiply the counted numbers together (e.g. if "danny" appeared 6 times, and "elise" appeared 2 times, the answer would be 6 * 2 = 12). Using my code for [Blobs](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/1.%20Blobs.md) as a base, I was able to write a [9-line program](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/Assets/Buckets.py) to solve Buckets:

    fileChoice = input("Enter a file to analyze: ")
    stringSearch = input("Enter a string to search for: ")
    
    with open(fileChoice) as f:
        lines = [inLine.rstrip() for inLine in f]
    
    hitCounter = 0
    
    for line in lines:
        if stringSearch in line:
            hitCounter += 1
    
    
    print("The string " + stringSearch + " was found " + str(hitCounter) + " time(s).")

After running the code twice to search for each name, “danny” was found 915 times and “elise” was found 1035 times. The final answer was 947025.
