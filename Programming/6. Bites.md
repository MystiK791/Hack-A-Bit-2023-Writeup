## Bites
We were given a [blob of hexadecimal data](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/Assets/bites.bin), and instructed to do the following:
-   Convert every byte in the blob to an integer, ignoring the hex values 0x00 and 0x01, and then add up all the integers.

This would have been extremely simple if I hadnâ€™t misinterpreted the instructions. Due to the way they were worded, I initially thought that you needed to add up all the data between hex *addresses* 0x02 and 0xFF (in other words, all data from the third byte of the file to the 256th byte). Even after figuring out the instructions, I still had some trouble solving the challenge. I tried making a Python script to log all the bytes in a file, ignoring the values 0x00 and 0x01. It logged the bytes just fine, but it didn't ignore the aforementioned hex values.
    
After an hour of debugging, I came up with a much simpler solution: open the blob in a hex editor and delete any data I was supposed to ignore. This turned out to work just fine, as the [freeware hex editor HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) has a function to search specific hex values in a file, and replace them. Better yet, if the "Replace With" input is left completely blank, HxD will delete whatever bytes it's told to search for. With the file I then re-ran my broken python code, and got the answer:
