We were given these instructions:

My original strategy was to use cURL to interface with the website, but the program kept failing to connect to the server. I was recommended the library Pwntools instead, which fully emulates a web browser and therefore can interface with websites better than cURL. I came up with [the following Python code](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/Assets/Wrench.py) after switching to Pwntools:

    from pwn import *
    import time
    
    conn = remote('strfjebijc.qualifier.hackabit.com', 54321)
    
    
    test = []
    
    byte = conn.recvuntil(b'total:', drop = False)
    
    time.sleep(2)
    
    test.append(byte.decode())
    
    letters = test[0].split("\n")
    
    numbers = []
    
    for string in letters:
        try:
            numbers.append(int(string))
        except:
            null = 0
    
    total = 0
    
    for number in numbers:
        total += number
    
    print(total)
    
    stringtotal = str(total)
    
    print(stringtotal)
    
    payload = bytes(stringtotal, "ascii")
    
    flag = conn.send(bytes(stringtotal, "ascii"))
    
    print(flag)

I tried running the code, only to have the connection be refused (I cannot show the exact error unfortunately, as the server no longer exists). I searched through the jumble of error messages to find something about a connection being refused by my operating system. I was on Windows at the time, so I decided to try running the code on Linux instead. First-try, the program successfully connected to the website, added the numbers, and sent them back. I was presented with the flag:

    flag{i_feel_the_need_the_need_for_speed}
