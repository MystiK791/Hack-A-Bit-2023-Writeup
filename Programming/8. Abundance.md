## Abundance

We were given [a Linux binary](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/Assets/abundance). As I did far too often in this competition, I ignored the learning material and went straight to running the binary. It asked what the binaryâ€™s entry point was. Using an [online decompiler](https://dogbolt.org/), I was able to see the value that it was looking for, which was 0x1100. I then passed that value to the program:

In all my years of computer science research, never before has a program behaved like a disgruntled teenager towards me.

I finally came to my senses and consulted the learning material. The first two sections explained what a stack was in computer memory, and why variable size matters in C, respectively. The third section however was about buffer overflows... of course! A buffer overflow, put simply, is when a program is given more data than it expected, and doesn't know what to do with it all. I have some experience with buffer overflows, as they're often used to open the door to user-made code (referred to as "homebrew") on video game consoles, usually by tricking the system into loading a file that's had insane amounts of data added to it. 

Now, usually a buffer overflow results in a program crashing or locking up. However, if it was in the learning material, it obviously had something to do with the challenge solution, and what did I have to lose by attempting one with the binary I was given? I simply spammed the input field with a massive wall of text, and the program gave me the flag:
