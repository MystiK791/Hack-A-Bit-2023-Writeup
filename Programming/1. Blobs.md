## Blobs
We were given [this text file](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/Assets/blobs.txt) containing thousands of arrow-shaped Unicode characters, and some coordinates at the beginning of the file. We were instructed to take the file, and do the following:
    
-   Define an X and Y variable starting at the coordinate provided
-   Increase or decrease the X and Y value based on which way each arrow was pointing (for example, with every up arrow (↑), increase the Y value by one).
-   Multiply the resulting X and Y values together, and submit the product as our answer

I built [this Python program](https://github.com/MystiK791/Hack-A-Bit-2023-Writeup/blob/main/Programming/Assets/Blobs.py) to quickly solve the problem:

    x = int(input("Enter the initial X value: "))
    y = int(input("Enter the initial Y value: "))
    coords = input("Enter the string of movements: ")
    coords = coords.replace(' ', '')
    
    for char in coords:
        match char:
            case '↑':
                y += 1
            case '↗':
                x += 1
                y += 1
            case '→':
                x += 1
            case '↘':
                x += 1
                y -= 1
            case '↓':
                y -= 1
            case '↙':
                x -= 1
                y -= 1
            case '←':
                x -= 1
            case '↖':
                x -= 1
                y += 1
            case ' ':
                x += 0
                y += 0
            
    print(x)
    print(y) 
The reason I opted to have the characters pasted into the shell instead of reading them directly from the file was simple: It’s easier to write 2 lines of code to handle an input and strip out all the whitespace than it is to write code to do the following:
    

-   Open a file
    
-   Strip all newline characters
    
-   Separate the arrows from the coordinates
    
-   Parse the coordinates and assign them to their own X and Y variables
    
-   Put all the arrows into a list
    
-   Strip out all the whitespace from the list containing the arrows


The final X and Y coordinates were 228 and -8885, and the total was -1208360
